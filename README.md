This is the code repository for [Hands-On GPU Computing with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-gpu-computing-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=), published by Packt.

**Explore the capabilities of GPUs for solving high performance computational problems**

## What is this book about?
GPUs are proving to be excellent general purpose-parallel computing solutions for high performance tasks such as deep learning and scientific computing.

This book will be your guide to getting started with GPU computing. It will start with introducing GPU computing and explain the architecture and programming models for GPUs. You will learn, by example, how to perform GPU programming with Python, and you’ll look at using integrations such as PyCUDA, PyOpenCL, CuPy, Numba, Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch with Anaconda for various tasks such as machine learning, data mining and scientific computing. Going further, you will get to grips with GPU work flows, management, and deployment using modern containerization solutions. Toward the end of the book, you will get familiar with the principles of distributed computing for training machine learning models and enhancing efficiency and performance.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Utilize Python libraries and frameworks for GPU acceleration
* Set up a GPU-enabled programmable machine learning environment on your system with Anaconda
* Deploy your machine learning system on cloud containers with illustrated examples
* Explore PyCUDA and PyOpenCL and compare them with platforms such as CUDA, OpenCL and ROCm.
* Perform data mining tasks with machine learning models on GPUs
* Extend your knowledge of GPU computing in scientific applications

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
// Run function on 500 Million elements on the CPU
  begin = clock();
  multiply(N, p, q);
  end = clock();
  cpu_time_used = ((double) (end - begin)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Data Scientist, Machine Learning enthusiasts and professionals who wants to get started with GPU computation and perform the complex tasks with low-latency. Intermediate knowledge of Python programming is assumed.

With the following software list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
